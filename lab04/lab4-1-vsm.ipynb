To avoid long cells of codes in the notebook, you can also embed long python functions and classes in a separate module. Donâ€™t forget to hand in your module if that is the case. In multiple exercises, you are required to come up with your own method to solve various problems. Be creative and clearly motivate and explain your methods. Creativity and clarity will be considered for grading.*"

      "{'courseId': 'COM-308', 'name': 'Internet analytics', 'description': 'Internet analytics is the collection, modeling, and analysis of user data in large-scale online services, such as social networking, e-commerce, search, and advertisement. This class explores a number of the key functions of such online services that have become ubiquitous over the past decade. Content The class seeks a balance between foundational but relatively basic material in algorithms, statistics, graph theory and related fields, with real-world applications inspired by the current practice of internet and cloud services. Specifically, we look at social & information networks, recommender systems, clustering and community detection, search/retrieval/topic models, dimensionality reduction, stream computing, and online ad auctions. Together, these provide a good coverage of the main uses for data mining and analytics applications in social networking, e-commerce, social media, etc. The course is combination of theoretical materials and weekly laboratory sessions, where we explore several large-scale datasets from the real world. For this, you will work with a dedicated infrastructure based on Hadoop & Apache Spark. \\xa0 Keywords data mining; machine learning; social networking; map-reduce; hadoop; recommender systems; clustering; community detection; topic models; information retrieval; stream computing; ad auctions Learning Prerequisites Required courses Stochastic models in communication (COM-300) Recommended courses Basic linear algebra Algorithms & data structures \\xa0 Important concepts to start the course Graphs; linear algebra; Markov chains; Java Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Explore real-world data from online servicesDevelop frameworks and models for typical data mining problems in online servicesAnalyze the efficiency and effectiveness of these modelsdata-mining and machine learning techniques to concrete real-world problems Teaching methods Ex cathedra homeworks lab sessions Expected student activities Lectures with associated homeworks explore the basic models and fundamental concepts. The labs are designed to explore very practical questions based on a number of large-scale real-world datasets we have curated for the class. The labs draw on knowledge acquired in the lectures, but are hands-on and self-contained. Assessment methods Project 20%, midterm 30%, final exam 50%'}\n"
